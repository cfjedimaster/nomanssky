No Mans Sky Stuff
===

This repository is for a tool I wanted to build to help with NMS crafting. Specifically I want the ability to say I want 1 X, 2 Y, and then have a report of how many raw items I need. 

There are items missing currently because they are not yet written on the wiki. They include:

* Statis Device
* Iridesite
* Magno-Gold
* Quantum Processor
* Cryogenic Chamber
* Hot Ice
* Fusion Igniter
* Ammonium Salt

My thinking is - modify getBuildable.js to have a hard coded set of data so it can be merged in gracefully with the rest of the data. To do that I'll need to figure out the items above (hint, you can help!).
